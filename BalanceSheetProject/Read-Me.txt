This readme file should be used as an instruction guide for the execution of the code.

The execution has different sections and validations based on the flow of making a balancesheet

Section 1- (Verification of Trial Balance)
 
 ->concept: the sum of credits and debits should be the same in the trial balance to proceed in the Next section

*In the execution of the code - 
	.Enter the path of the raw trial balance.<the path on your Pc in the input field>
	.The program will prompt for the same.
		-Structure of the Trial Balance
			the trial balance *Must* have 4 columns-
			1."Particulars",

	.Ensure the structure of the trial balance is maintained.
	.Here the Particulars are read and the Grouping is done by calling Chatgpt-API 4-o.
	.This execution needs some time to execute "Do not turn of program Execution as it will to extra cost for the API calls".
	.The Grouped output is Saved to the path provided.
	.This Grouped trial Balance should be used for the input for the schedules.
